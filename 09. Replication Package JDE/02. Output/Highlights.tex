\begin{itemize}
    \item We use a vignette experiment to study the influence of perceived job competition on outgroup attitudes in refugee hosting contexts of Ethiopia and Uganda.
    \item Pooled results suggest that perceived job competition is tied to more negative host attitudes towards refugees. These results are driven by host respondents in Addis Ababa.
    \item Heterogeneity analysis reveals attributes the main results to hosts who work in industry-locations with very limited refugee presence.
    \item Additional heterogeneity results provide evidence that ethnic and linguistic proximity, as well as prior contact, are tied to less negative attitudes towards refugees.
